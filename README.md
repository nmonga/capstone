# capstone

This is a functional version of the code used for my capstone project at the Data incubator's Data Science Fellowship. 

The code attempts at predicting stock prices by using patent features (claim count, length, citation count) as exogenous variables
in ARIMAX models. Implementation of the model was done by using the statsmodels API and the pmdrima API. 

A brief description of the project and technical details can be found at: https://physmon.wordpress.com/technical-details/
